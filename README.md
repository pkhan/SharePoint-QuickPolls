SharePoint-QuickPolls
=====================

A JavaScript only poll that can be inserted onto any page in SharePoint

This is a fairly basic polling utility that can be thrown onto any SharePoint page. It uses SharePoint web services to interact with two SharePoint lists. One is to hold the questions, the other to hold the individual votes. 

Current version:
-Must set up the two lists ahead of time, and add questions to the questions list directly

Ideal features:
-List creation and question addition all from the library and web service calls
